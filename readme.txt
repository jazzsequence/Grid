a stylish, grid-based theme that mocks grid-based themes.

== Description ==

Grid is a theme I started working on for my own site and decided to make it available as a free theme.  I wanted a dark theme this time around, and I wanted to play with the idea of having a grid background like Justin Tadlock's site and the optional grid.png background image you get when you're working in the blueprintCSS framework.  I also wanted to play around with layering text on top of itself in a way that partially obscures the content.  As such, this theme isn't for everyone, but I'm pretty ecstatic about it.  Grid uses a variable-width layout, so it's always taking up the full screen no matter what resolution you are using.  It has support for Asides, 4 widget areas in the footer and one in the sidebar, optional left/right sidebar and full posts/post excerpts on the blog page, and built-in Twitter hovercards.

== Installation ==

1. Unpack and upload the contents of `grid.zip` to the `/wp-content/themes/` directory.
2. Activate the theme through the *Themes* menu in WordPress.
3. That's it!  You can now check out the Grid Options page under *Appearance* and customize aspects of the theme.
